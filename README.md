# car_dealer_manager_python
Python project with Tkinter and SQLite


To run this project, run MainTest2.py

Admin can update, delete, add a new car to the database and delete users' transactions.

User can create a new account or log in to an existing account.

User can book a car, view their transactions, update their account and also delete account.

I didn't let admin to manage users' accounts (like updating, deleting) because I found it unnecesary when users have this options.
